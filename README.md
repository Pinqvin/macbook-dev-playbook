# Macbook Dev playbook

This repository is effectively a worse version of [Jeff Geerling's mac-dev-playbook.](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook) Initial idea was to make more customisations, but in the end it's doing pretty much the same things as the playbook it's based on. Funny how that works out

## Running the playbook

For setup, [follow the guidance on mac-dev-playbook repo.](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook#installation)

To run the changes, use the following command:

```
ansible-playbook main.yml --ask-become-pass
```
